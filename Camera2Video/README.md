## IoT APK Camera2Video features
--------------
This chapter explains the features of IoT APK Camera2Video app for QCS610 and QCS605 platforms.

### IoT APK Camera2Video basic features

This section covers the basic features of the IoT APK Camera2Video application based on the following tabs:
* SINGLE CAM tab
* MULTI CAM tab
* SETTINGS tab


#### SINGLE CAM tab

This screen is for recording video and capturing snapshot for a single camera. The camera can be front or back based on the **Camera IDs** setting selected from the **SETTINGS** tab. Media goes to the DCIM/Camera folder. It is possible to selectively choose to enable preview, snapshot and record functionality. It has the following features:<br />

- **Record button**: It is green by default. When tapped, the button turns to red, which indicates that the recording is in progress. To stop the recording, press the button again. The minimum duration of a video recording is 1 second.
- **Chronometer**: The chronometer is hidden by default and displays the time elapsed since the recording started.
- **Snapshot button**: Users can tap on the button to get the snapshot. App can capture snapshot in between recording video.
- **Thumbnail button**: The thumbnail button displays the last recorded video or captured snapshot. It shows a default icon on launch. When tapped, it leads to the gallery to view the media from where the user can return by pressing the back button.

#### MULTI CAM tab

This screen is for taking capture and record video from the multiple cameras. Media goes to the **DCIM/Camera** folder. It is possible to selectively choose to enable preview, snapshot and record functionality. It has the following features:
- **Record button**: It is green by default. When tapped, the button turns to red, which indicates that the recording is in progress. To stop the recording, press the button again. It records videos simultaneously from every camera. The minimum duration of a video recording is 1 second.
- **Chronometer**: The chronometer is hidden by default and displays the time elapsed since recording started.
- **Snapshot button**: Users can tap the button to capture multiple images (one from every camera) simultaneously. Users can take snapshots in between recording too.
- **Thumbnail button**: It shows a default icon always. When tapped, it leads to the gallery to view the media from where the user can return by tapping the **Back** button.

[the third camera only creates a raw stream, which can be tested with a capture image.]<br>Go to the MULTI CAM tab.<br>10. Press the Video capture button. |

### LDT Testing
End Client can disable "Store Video File" to run the LDT use case.

<img src="documentation_resources/device9.png" height="300" alt="Screenshot"/><br />


### Frame Skip Interface

FrameSkip implementation enables user to have lesser(Desired) fps for the encoded stream.<br />
Suppose Sensor is streaming at 30 fps and user needs a stream of say 15 fps. So user can enable this by setting the correct fps in setting of that stream.<br />

**This will work if you have enabled overlay on that stream with desired FPS.**<br />


### Shared Streams

#### Rescaled Stream

Rescaler implementation enables the end user to create a rescaled stream which is generated using OPENGL ES. It will use this interface to get shared stream from camera and finally it will pass through OPENGL ES interface for rescaling.<br />
This will work if you have enabled overlay on that stream with desired stream resolution.
Resolution should be different [Less] from the source.<br />


##### Use Case

Display  : 1920 * 1080 [From Camera]<br />
Snapshot : Off <br />
Stream 0 : 3840 * 2160 @30 [From Camera]<br />
Stream 1 : 1920 * 1080 @30 [From Camera]<br />
Stream 2 : 640 * 480 @ 30    [We need to enable overlay here.] [This is the rescaled use case.] [Stream 1 and Stream 2 will share buffer and finally Stream 2 will go through OPENGL ES for rescaler.]<br />

############################################<br />

Display    : 1920 * 1080 [From Camera]<br />
Snapshot : Off <br />
Stream 0  : 3840 * 2160 @30 [From Camera]<br />
Stream 1 : 640 * 480 @ 30     [We need to enable overlay here.] [This is the rescaled use case.] [Stream 1 and Stream 2 will share buffer and finally Stream 1 will go through OPENGL ES for rescaler.]<br />
Stream 2 : 1920 * 1080 @30  [From Camera]<br />

############################################<br />

#### Linked Stream

Linked stream implementation enables end user to have one more stream whose buffers are being shared with source stream. It will use this interface for buffer sharing.<br />
This will work if you have configured streams with similar resolution.<br />


##### Use Case

Display    : 1920 * 1080 [From Camera]<br />
Snapshot : Off <br />
Stream 0 : 1920 * 1080 @30 [From Camera]<br />
Stream 1 : 640 * 480 @30 [From Camera]<br />
Stream 2 : 640 * 480 @30 [Stream 1 and Stream 2 will share buffer] [No need to enable overlay if FPS is same as Stream 1]<br />

############################################<br />
```
NOTE FOR SINGLE CAM TAB
Camera can only generate 3 streams as we have those pipelines available in CAMX.
Rescaled Stream and Linked Stream configuration will only works for Stream 1 and Stream 2 if Display is enable and snapshot is disabled for Single Cam use case.
if snapshot and display is enabled, then Stream 0/1/2 will be considered as shared stream based on resolution.
If display and snapshot is off, then all the stream [0/1/2] are from camera in single camera use case.
Shared streams are kept from in the order Stream 2/1/0.
```
```
NOTE FOR MULTICAM TAB
Camera can only generate 3 streams as we have those pipelines available in CAMX.
Rescaled Stream and Linked Stream configuration will only works for Stream 0 and Stream 1 if Display and snapshot is enable for Dual Cam use case.
If display and snapshot is on, then all the stream [0/1] and snapshot stream are from camera in dual camera use case.
For Dual camera tab only Stream 0 and Stream 1 configurations are valid.
```

##### Dual Camera Use Case Example

Display    : 1920 * 1080 [From Camera]<br />
Snapshot Stream: [From Camera]<br />
Stream 0 : 1920 * 1080 @30 [From Camera]<br />
Stream 1 : 640 * 480 @30 [We need to enable overlay] [Stream 0 and Stream 1 will share buffer] [This is the rescaled use case.] [Stream 0 and Stream 1 will share buffer and finally Stream 2 will go through OPENGL ES for rescaler.]<br />

######################################<br />

Display    : 1920 * 1080 [From Camera]<br />
Snapshot Stream: [From Camera]<br />
Stream 0 : 1920 * 1080 @30 [From Camera]<br />
Stream 1 : 1920 * 1080 @30 [Stream 0 and Stream 1 will share buffer] [This is the  linked stream use case.] [Stream 0 and Stream 1 will share buffer]<br />

######################################<br />

Display    : Display is off.<br />
Snapshot Stream:                  [From Camera]<br />
Stream 0 : 1920 * 1080 @30 [From Camera]<br />
Stream 1 : 1920 * 1080 @30  [From Camera]<br />
